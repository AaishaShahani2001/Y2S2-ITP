# 🐾 PetPulse — Pet Care & Adoption Management System (MERN)

PetPulse is a full-stack MERN application designed to streamline pet adoption and pet care service management. The platform enables users to browse adoptable pets, book care services, submit adoption requests, and track application statuses, while administrators manage pets, care bookings, and approval workflows through a secure dashboard.

This project was developed as a semester system with industry-style workflows, role-based access control, and real-world CRUD operations.
